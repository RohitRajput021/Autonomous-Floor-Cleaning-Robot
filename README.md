## Introduction

This project focuses on creating a robotic floor cleaner that can autonomously navigate an indoor environment, clean surfaces using a mop, and automatically return to a charging station when the battery is low. Utilizing ultrasonic and infrared sensors, along with SLAM and A* pathfinding algorithms, the robot detects obstacles, determines optimal cleaning paths, and ensures complete floor coverage.

   - Set up the docking station with proper charging connectors.

2. **Install Microcontroller Software**:
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266 microcontroller, ensuring it includes navigation and sensor handling logic.

3. **Configure Power Management**:
   - Calibrate the BMS for safe charging and discharging cycles.

4. **Install Software Dependencies**:
   - On your development machine, install necessary Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
     ```

5. **Upload the Code**:
   - Upload the main navigation and control code to the microcontroller.

## Usage

1. **Starting the Robot**:
   - Place the robot on the floor in the desired cleaning area.
   - Power it on and initialize its connection to the gateway for remote control if necessary.

2. **Automatic Cleaning**:
   - The robot will begin cleaning and avoiding obstacles autonomously.

3. **Self-Charging**:
   - When the battery is low, the robot will navigate back to the docking station for charging.

## How It Works

- **Navigation**: The robot uses SLAM to create a map of the environment, and the A* algorithm helps it find the shortest path to clean and return to the docking station.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic and infrared sensors help detect obstacles and adjust the path.
- **Self-Charging**: Using the location data from SLAM, the robot can find its way back to the docking station when the battery is low.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Remote Control**: Adding WiFi or Bluetooth for better remote control.
- **Obstacle Avoidance with AI**: Use AI-based object recognition to distinguish between obstacles.
- **Floor Type Detection**: Differentiate floor types and adjust cleaning methods accordingly.
- **App Integration**: Develop a mobile app for real-time monitoring and control.
